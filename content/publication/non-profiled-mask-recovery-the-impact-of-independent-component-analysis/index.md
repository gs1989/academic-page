title: "Non-profiled Mask Recovery: The Impact of Independent Component Analysis"
publication_types:
  - "1"
abstract: As one of the most prevalent SCA countermeasures, masking schemes are
  designed to defeat a broad range of side channel attacks. An attack vector
  that is suitable for low-order masking schemes is to try and directly
  determine the mask(s) (for each trace) by utilising the fact that often an
  attacker has access to several leakage points of the respectively used
  mask(s). Good examples for implementations of low-order masking schemes
  include the table re-computation schemes as well as the masking scheme in
  DPAContest V4.2. We propose a novel approach based on Independent Component
  Analysis (ICA) to efficiently utilise the information from several leakage
  points to reconstruct the respective masks (for each trace) and show it is a
  competitive attack vector in practice.
