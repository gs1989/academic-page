title: Constructing TI-Friendly Substitution Boxes Using Shift-Invariant Permutations
publication_types:
  - "1"
abstract: The threat posed by side channels requires ciphers that can be
  efficiently protected in both software and hardware against such attacks. In
  this paper, we proposed a novel Sbox construction based on iterations of
  shift-invariant quadratic permutations and linear diffusions. Owing to the
  selected quadratic permutations, all of our Sboxes enable uniform 3-share
  threshold implementations, which provide first order SCA protections without
  any fresh randomness. More importantly, because of the “shift-invariant”
  property, there are ample implementation trade-offs available, in software as
  well as hardware. We provide implementation results (software and hardware)
  for a four-bit and an eight-bit Sbox, which confirm that our constructions are
  competitive and can be easily adapted to various platforms as claimed. We have
  successfully verified their resistance to first order attacks based on real
  acquisitions. Because there are very few studies focusing on software-based
  threshold implementations, our software implementations might be of
  independent interest in this regard.
