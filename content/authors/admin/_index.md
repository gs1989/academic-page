I got my BSc in CS (more specifically, information security) at Wuhan University back in 2011. Guided by Prof. Ming Tang, I started my side-channel research around 2010 as an undergraduate student and keep that as my main research topic during my PhD at the Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences from 2011 to 2017. After graduation, I started my Pos-doc journey with Prof. Elisabeth Oswald at the Univerisity of Bristol, UK; then move to AAU, Austria around Dec. 2019 and continue working on the same project.

During my last 10 years of research in side-channel analysis and implementation security, I think it is fair to say I touched "a bit of everything" (you might even notice that from my publication list): from RTL implementation to cryptoanalysis, from assembly programming to embedded development, from industrial practice to abstract crypto theory, from CPU architecture to digital oscilloscopes. It is equally fair to say I am not an expert in any above area: I learn things when it becomes necessary for my work. I am an expert in terms of power-based side-channel analysis, leakage detection and analysis (usually only the practical side of the story), regression/statistical modelling etc, yet I guess those are only interesting for a limited group of audience...

Working in a multi-discipline field, my passion lies in interfacing between multiple backgrounds, eg.  academic v.s. industry, crypto v.s. hardware/software implementation, SCA v.s. statistics,  security v.s. other components of the system.  I usually like to talk with people from different backgrounds and understand their requirements and needs (assuming I am free at the moment), as long as people do not mind explaining some basic ground truth in their field to me and willing to view the problem out of their usual perspective. That has been said if what you are looking for is some quick and simple (or fairly speaking, ridiculous!) statement such as "software implementations do not have glitches", talking to me might not be the best thing to do: there are already too many overly-simplified misleading/divisive statements in the community and I am not into contributing further...

Details about my work and projects can be found in my CV. Happy visiting and hopefully you have fun!
